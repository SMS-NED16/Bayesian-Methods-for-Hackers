# Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers 

Notebooks with my explanations, comments, and code for examples and exercises from [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers). 

Completed mainly to improve my understanding of the Bayesian modeling workflow.
